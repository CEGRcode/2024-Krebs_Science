This directory contains scripts to pileup select BAM files against select RefPT BED file and saves the analysis to `2023-Krebs_BenzonaseSeq/Library`.

Please make sure your BAM files are downloaded and indexed in the appropriate directory (`data/BAM/`) with normalization factors calculated (`data/BAM/NormalizationFactors/`) and reference points built (`data/RefPT-XXX`).

The user should update the working directory ($WRK) filepath variable within every script before executing

See `00_Download_and_preprocessing` to read more about how BAM files were built.
See `02_Call_Nucleosomes`, `03_Call_JASPAR` and `04_Call_Motifs` to read more about how RefPT files were built.

Scripts were designed to run on linux systems with a Slurm scheduler. Simply update `WRK` to match the directory path where you cloned this repo and set the `#SBATCH --array 1,2-10` to the range you wish to execute.

- No Slurm scheduler? `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` can be hardcoded and run as a regular shell script
